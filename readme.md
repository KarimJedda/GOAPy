## About GOAP

Goal-Oriented Action Planning is a generic architecture for autonomous AI.

By taking the current state of the AI (e.g.: Hungry? Tired?) and their desired state (e.g.: Not hungry? Not tired?) a "plan" is generated to take the AI from their current state to their goal state by considering a list of actions. By attaching weights to these actions, GOAP is capable of producing highly dynamic results.

## Example
